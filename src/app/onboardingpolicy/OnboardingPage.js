<br/><br/>
● Electricity charges can be covered as a part of the Monthly Rent or it can be incremental to the Monthly Rent. Please refer to www.unionliving.in to get the details about it for the property you belong to or connect with respective team members.
<br/>
● In case if the electricity charges are to be borne by the residents, these charges will be passed on to residents by following method
<br/>
● Electricity meter readings will be taken latest by the 28 th day of the month.
<br/>
● Based on meter previous meter readings taken, electricity unit consumptions will be calculated for the said period
<br/>
● Based on the number of units consumed, appropriate per unit charge (as per electricity distribution company’s calculator) for that usage slab in INR will be used to calculate the electricity charges for the respective meter.
<br/>
● Electric charge for the meter will be distributed among the residents covered by it in proportion to their number of days stay in the month, as per joining date. Electricity charges for two residents in a flat/room can differ if their number of days stay is different.
<br/>
● In case if a customer is exiting from the property in the middle of the month, the average per day bill for the customer for the previous month will be used to calculate the pro-rata electricity charges for days post last billing date.
<br/>
● We do not use/share original electricity bills for splitting/charging electricity to customers because The meter reading dates are different for different meters in the same property, so the bills cannot be properly split and allocated to all the customers at one go.
<br/>
● The electricity bill is generated with almost a month’s delay from the electricity distribution company. It is very likely that by that time some of the customers who have used the accounted electricity can exit the property putting their burden on other residents left behind. We don’t want our customers to suffer because of freeriding of a few individuals.
