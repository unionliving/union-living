          From the lack of discoverability of millennial friendly spaces to having to deal with leaks and locks by yourself, it’s a vicious cycle. <br /> By spotlighting the resident experience and zeroing in on their unique concerns and housing needs, our occupancy rates are best-in-class. <br />  Whilst coliving is being recognised as a form of asset-class, we have started to create and design our own supply, generating rental yield like never before.
